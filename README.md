# Web Development Projects

My continuous assessment projects for [CS1116 (Web Development 2)](https://ucc-ie-public.courseleaf.com/modules/?details&srcdb=2023&code=CS1116).

## CA1

The first project is an online movie database created using Flask. It allows users to search for and review movies, create lists, see statistics on their viewing habits, and see suggestions for new movies to watch. There also tools to allow administrators to add new movies to the database.

## CA2

The second project is a top-down client-side game. Players aim to complete the game by navigating through a series of randomly generated levels while avoiding the enemies. Players collect treasures to increase their score and potentially gain an inventory item or power-up. Players can track their progress and be listed on the leaderboard if they choose to log in.

## Requirements

These projects require the following Python packages:

- `flask`
- `python-dotenv`
- `flask-wtf`
- `flask-session`
